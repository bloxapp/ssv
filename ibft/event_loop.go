Multi threading in iBFT instance -

The iBFT instance is a single thread service.
All the different events (reading network messages, timeouts, etc) are brokered through an event queue.

Events are added asynchronically to the queue but are pulled synchronically in just one place, the main event loop.

"Timer:
	In addition to the State variables, each correct process pi also maintains a timer represented by timeri,

	When set to running, it is also set a time t(ri), which is an exponential function of the round number ri, after which the State changes to expired."
