# Differ :mag_right: :left_right_arrow: :mag:

Differ is a robust Go codebase comparison tool that enables you to easily identify relevant changes across codebases at a per-struct, per-function, and per-method level. With Differ, you can focus on the changes that matter and ignore the rest.

## :sparkles: Capabilities

- :zap: Swiftly compare between two codebases, unaffected by differences in package paths or file names.
- :see_no_evil: Ignore changes considered irrelevant or approved.
- :link: Compares only structs, methods and functions with matching names.

## :gear: Installation

Differ doesn't require a special installation step. Just clone the repository and you're good to go!

```bash
go install github.com/bloxapp/ssv/scripts/differ@latest
```

## :rocket: Usage

```bash
differ --left <leftCodebasePath> --right <rightCodebasePath> --output <outputFile>
```

### Configuration

The `config.yaml` file is used to fine-tune the behavior of Differ.

```yaml
# List of approved change IDs to ignore.
ApprovedChanges: []

# Identifiers to ignore during comparison.
IgnoredIdentifiers:
  - logger

# Package names that should be reduced to their last component.
ReducedPackageNames:
  - ssv
  - qbft

# Pairs of packages to compare across the codebases.
Comparisons:
  - Left:
      - ./protocol/v2/ssv/runner
    Right:
      - ./ssv
  - Left:
      - protocol/v2/qbft/controller
      - protocol/v2/qbft/instance
    Right:
      - ./qbft
```
